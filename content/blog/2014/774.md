	Zhwen Xu(Zhenwen Xu, 许振文 in Chinese), post-graduate student majored in the <a href="http://cs.xupt.edu.cn">CS Department</a> of <a href="http://www.xupt.edu.cn">Xi'an  University of Post and Telecommunications</a>. 
	My majore is embedded system.
	During my four years collage life, I mainly majored network system, and did a deeply understanding of net system especially in Linux system. I did some reach on Netfilter and Netlink (both are Linux kernel mechanism),
	 and did the last develop work for graduating. During that time I also developed web site for some department of my school and other schools. And started my own WEB study studio with other three friends.
	I became a bona-fidel Linux programmer when I began my graduate studies. My tutoris a Linux fan, so I became a one too. So I did much work on embedded Linux system. I know how to make it run, 
	how to develop device drivers and applications. And I joined some Internet technical community, like Xiyou-Linux-Group, Zh-kernel, zeuux, Chinanuix, and LUPA where all kinks of questions and issues about Linux are discussed. 
	This community interaction has has made a profound influence on my programming ability and enhanced my theoretical knowledge. Moreover,
	 I have made many good friends within these communities and with their help and support my programming expertises continues to be strengthened. 
	I have been using GNU/Linux for more than 5 years now. 3 years ago, And now my GNU/Linux distribution is Debian. I am using the unstable version (called sid) of Debian without any problems. I really love this Linux. It's smart, clean and romantic.
	I am a linuxer, a programmer, a student, a worker and surely, a man.
